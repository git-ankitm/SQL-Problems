Question: Write an SQL query to report the shortest distance between any two points from the Point table.

Point table:
+----+
| x  |
+----+
| -1 |
| 0  |
| 2  |
+----+
Output: 
+----------+
| shortest |
+----------+
| 1        |
+----------+

Answer:
WITH all_distances AS (
  SELECT 
    a.x AS x1, 
    b.x AS x2, 
    ABS(a.x - b.x) AS distance
  FROM Point a
  CROSS JOIN Point b
  WHERE a.x != b.x
)
SELECT MIN(distance) AS shortest
FROM all_distances;

In this query, we first use a Common Table Expression (CTE) named "all_distances" to calculate the distance between all possible pairs of points in the Point 
table. The CTE uses a cross join to generate all possible combinations of points, and the distance is calculated as the absolute difference between the 
x-coordinates of each pair. If we didn't exclude such cases, the CTE would generate pairs of the form (x, x) for each x in the Point table, which would result
in a distance of 0. The condition a.x != b.x ensures a point is not compared with itself. Finally, the outer query selects the minimum distance from all 
valid pairs, giving the shortest distance between any two distinct points.
